# Zuma inspired game 

This was a college assignment for the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures. I was asked to "propose a game and develop it in Python with the graphics library (http://anh.cs.luc.edu/handsonPythonTutorial/graphics.html)".

Design is not one of my strengths, so I decided to develop a game that is visually simple but at the same time involves some interestingly dynamic elements. The code is completely functional, it met all the requirements of the assigment. However, there are some mathematical things that I would've liked to improve, but it wasn't possible due to time constraints.
